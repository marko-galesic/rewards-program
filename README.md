Charter Communications Interview Project

You should be able to download and import this project into IntelliJ to get this running. This exposes one endpoint, `/submit-transaction`, that takes, a file, and a URL boolean param `total`. If `total` is true, the endpoint returns total points calculated per customer, or, if false, return the total points per customer per month.

`transactions.txt` is the test data for this endpoint.
